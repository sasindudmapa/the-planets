    overview:
      "Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun but, perhaps surprisingly, it does not have the highest temperatures. It is the second densest planet of the Solar System, but also the smallest planet. The structure of Mercury makes it the most similar planet to Earth.",
    internelStructure:
      "Mercury is a terrestrial planet having three main layers: a core, mantle and crust. Mercury’s crust has no tectonic plates and its iron core is enormous, making up 85% of the planets radius while Earth’s inner and outer core, account for about 55%.",

    internelStructure:
      "Venus is very similar to Earth in its structure. The core is posseses is approximately 2.000 miles or 3.200 kilometers in radius. Above that core rests a mantle of hot rock, slowly churning due to the planet’s interior heat. As a result the surface is a thin crust of rock that bulges and moves as Venus’s mantle shifts, and creates volcanoes.",

It is made of iron and nickel about 759 miles / 1.221 kilometers in radius. The temperatures at the core have been estimated to be around 9.800 degrees Fahrenheit / 5.400 degrees Celsius. This is hotter than the surface of the Sun.",

Its atmospheres forms about 5% to 10% of its mass and extends about 10% to 20% of the way towards the core reaching pressures of about 10 GPa or 100.000 times that of Earth’s atmosphere.
